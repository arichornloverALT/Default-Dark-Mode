1. Iron Horseshoes: increases speed by **2 blocks per second** and provides  **1.75 bars of armor**.
2. Golden Horseshoes: increases speed by **4 blocks per second** and provides **1.25 bars of armor**. 
3. Diamond Horseshoes: increases speed by **3 blocks per second** and provides **2.75 bars of armor**.

## Obtaining horseshoes

You can acquire iron and diamond horseshoes by trading with armorsmith villagers or by looting chests in the Overworld. Golden horseshoes can be found in chests inside Nether fortresses and bastions. 

## Enchanting

Players can use anvils to apply boot enchantments to horseshoes for greater utility. For example, you can apply the frost walker enchantment and enable your horse to easily cross bodies of water.
